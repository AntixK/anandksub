Pillai</h1><p class=tldr>Extensive notes on the book Gods, Guns and Missionaries by Manu S. Pillai</p><main><p>  It has been a while since I read a book purely for pleasure. Life has been, let's say, eventful recently, and I have been managing multiple things at once—negotiating, compromising, and adapting to the hopefully new normal. This brings us neatly to the theme of the 2024 book by Manu Pillai. Manu has been seeing a tremendous growth in popularity as an engaging writer of Indian history, boosted by his prolific writing.</p><p>Gods, Guns and Missionaries (notice the absence of the Oxford comma) presents the historical atmosphere of colonial India and how it shaped the country's religious landscape, especially Hinduism. The theme is far more relevant today; with the rise of Hindu nationalism in India, interest in the country's history—especially the parts where Hindus were persecuted—has greatly increased.</p><p>Manu sets the stage in the introductory chapter about the unique ability of Hindusim to negotiate, absorb ideas, and even compromise on their identity to create a new one. The marvellous ability of the Vedic people to adapt to local gods and even to unify different gods across the massive landscape of India into a single entity—be it through familial relationships or through avatars.</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>Tamil peotry has a Vaishanava steal a gold Buddha to fund a temple for Vishnu, while another delcares, 'Snatch the rice from the mouths of those who burden the earth! (speaking about Sramanic followers) Stuff them with grass instead!'.</p></div><br><div class=multilinequote><p>An eleventh-century Buddhist text, for instance, irreverently suggests that advocates of the Vedas might gel gloriously with Islam, given their shared fondness for violence.</p></div><br><div class=multilinequote><p>Saiva poetry, thus, presents Vishnu as a subject to Siva, as one who cannot presume to even comprehend that god. Vaishnavas returned the favor by showing Siva as Vishnu's appointment, his followers 'ignorant innocents'.</p></div><p>The equivalence created by the people between Rudra and Shiva, Vishnu and Vasudeva, Vishnu and Avalotiksvara, the various forms of the same god—like Pandurang Vithala and Krishna, even Buddha being an avatar of Vishnu in some cases—are all some interesting examples. Stotras - containing only the "leela" of Gods and their physical forms - became the predominant form of everyday worship. At times, when the Puranic ideas and Bhakti stotras became more predominant, Acharyas went to great lengths to argue that the Puranic ideas were an encapsulation of the Vedas. Nammalvar's <em>thiruvaimozhi</em> became a "Tamil Veda". Although the Vedic people adapted themselves to local religions, the primacy and superiority of the Vedas needed to be maintained. Even now, tremendous effort is being put into showing that that the <em>Thirukkural</em> is essentially an encapsulation of the Vedas.</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>Alter all, Hinduism was an 'amoeba-like cluster of practices and beliefs', stitching up countelss groups, ideologies, gods and identities in various periods across vast geographies. Each thread in this evolving web has a personality; each could inform and alter others while retaining its distinctness. Of course, there were links but by design, it was feasible for one book to authoritatively represent a bottom-up order like Hinduism. And in more real terms, the religion's outlines were fixed not so much by the Vedas but by the epics-theMahabharata and the Ramayana - along with orally transmitted Puranic tales. It is these that most Hindus identify with even today, the Vedas being primarily a restrcted Brahmin concern.</p></div><p>The scene changed with the advent of Europeans. In and around the 16th and 17th centuries, Italian, Portuguese, and Dutch missionaries wrote misunderstood, exaggerated, and often maligned accounts of Hinduism. As in everything, these early accounts became the standard for understanding about India for their countrymen back home. While the Vedic people practiced inclusivism and pluralism, incorporating all kinds of local gods and customs, these missionaries saw a land of eerie customs and superstitions and wanted to "cleanse" the land of these "pagan" practices.</p><p>As with today's, if I may say, predominantly white, tourists tend to box India into either an esoteric, yogic, mystic land or a land where crazy things happen—be it driving, poverty, or the dirt. For a while, the Portuguese and Dutch accounts were either unintelligible to most Hindus or they could not have cared. Manu continues</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>But as the white man's political power grew in the country, his skewed narratives—and prejudice these came to represent—acquired the ability to afflict their world. And so, these would slowly become a threat, till in time Hindus themselves were forced to answer the question: Who were they, really? If not devil-worshipers, what was their religion truly about? In a world where other (unfriendly) cultures could scrutinize their identity, how might they articulate their self-image? It was in the construction of these answers that Hinduism took its contemporary, modern form, drawing pride and confidence from certain aspects of its past and shame from others.</p></div><p>Interestingly, not all Europeans were initially prejudiced. Vasco De Gama and his men, reportedly, even presumed that a local Hindu temple in Kerala was a shrine to Mary, imagined differently by the local people. It was only when the trade deals went sour (which didn't take that long) and the arrival of the zealous missionaries that the Europeans began to see the Hindus as devil-worshippers. More and more Portuguese missionaries grew hostile with the ongoing eighty-year war in their homeland.</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>In 1540–41, hundreds of temples were razed, their assets appropriated for Christian institutions. By the decade's end, John III (John the Pious) outlawed Hinduism, commanding that since 'idolatory is such a big offsense aganist god...I will not tolerate it to exist. 'Goa's idols, 'in public and in hiding', must, he demanded, be crushed.... and the Inquisition too—targeting Jews originally—was imported to India.</p></div><br><div class=multilinequote><p>The irony, of course, as the scholar Alexander Henn reminds us, is that Catholics were stricking at Goa's idols—and idolator—in the same period that Protestants attacked their icons in Europe under the charge of idolatry. But precisely for this reason, there was no sympathy; the Portuguese had to demonstrate with fire and blood that they were authentic Christians. And Hindus suffered in the process.</p></div><p>ranam: Soma Sundaresvara Sukha Sphurti Rupini Syame Sankari Digvija</p><p>In fact, even the ancient Christians living in Kerala—the Nasranis—, supposedly converted by St. Thomas the Apostle in 52CE, were not spared by the Portuguese. Although they were indeed Christians, they weren't Catholic. These Nasranis were polluted by being around the Heathens, adopting Heathen customs, and living under a Heathen king. The following quip suggests that the ability to adapt one's faith is unique not to Vedic people but to Indians.</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>It divided Kerala's Christians, but enough in the community clung to the old ways; cock sacrifices continue, as do traditions in which figures like St. George are cast as siblings to fiery goddesses like Kali. Indeed, as late as 1806, when a local rajah was informed that the British and the Nasranis were of the same faith, he remarked that this 'could not be the case, else he must have heard it before'—so different was the 'native' Christian from the European.</p></div><p>Nasiris, too, resisted, as they had gained a higher caste privilege in Kerala in all these centuries, and the new converts were of lower caste (fishermen), and they did not want to give up their caste privilege. Even among the converted ones, the conversion happened "not because Jesus appeared to the fishermen in boats," but due to political rivalry with another group. Of course, resistance was intense—in Goa and everywhere these missionaries went. For example, the founder of the Society of Jesus, Francis Xavier, notes</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>... the father encountered an obstacle: the hold of a 'perverse and wicked set' of 'liars and cheats' known as Brahmins. Or, as Xavier admitted, were it not for these people, India's pagan masses would easily be 'embracing the religion of Jesus Christ'.</p></div><p>Xavier left India in frustration after three years. But as they have more conversations with the Brahmins,</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>...after talking of the usual 'devilish superstitions', added how Brahmins believed 'their [sic] is a supreme God above, which ruleth all things'. This now created a quandary: the assumptions that Hindus were photocopies of Europe's polytheists could not hold. Like former idol worshippers in the West, brown people have a list of dieties, yes, and yet they also acknowledged a single power. Without irony, their paganism was tethered to monotheism.</p></div><p>Nobody important believed idols were gods; they only symbolized the divine power. For missionaries, this sophisticated glimpse of Hindu ideas generated a problem, for they could no longer simply traffic in stereotypes. As such, the Brahmins were considered the principal defendants of Hinduism.</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>The land was easy to conquer; a conquest of souls warranted more meticulous efforts.</p></div><p>As Brahmins had begun to be viewed as equals to the missionaries in religio-philosophical matters, their social status within the colonial rule also improved. They started providing administrative support in Portuguese-controlled areas. While Xavier spewed vitriol against Hindus and their practices to mask his ignorance, other missionaries like Giacomo Fenicio started to engage with Brahmins in a more informed way. Catholic missionaries like Thomas Stephens even wrote the Kritapurana (Story of Christ) in a mix of Marathi and Konkani languages, defying the Catholic practice of keeping all scriptures in Latin. The Catholic missionaries from Portugal and the Protestant Dutch missionaries raced each other, attempting to convert local Rajas to convert them, spy on them, scout the kingdom and note down the locations of temples and treasures for looting, and to defend their faith and country from the other.</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>It really looked, then, as far as the Portuguese were concerned, as if God and the gun went hand in hand.</p></div><p>A sentiment relatable to many of America's extreme-right Christians of today. The Hindu kings, like the Japanese Shoguns/Daimyos, also leveraged this mindset. They allowed for normal tolerance to Christianity, building a church, and converting certain people, as long as the Portuguese supplied them with firearms and did not hesitate to switch sides between the Portuguese and the Dutch. Terms like "Parangi" (Franks) came to be associated with non-Portuguese Christians, just like how "Tulukan" (Turk) became associated with all Muslims in Tamil.</p><p>The missionaries also adapted. People like de Nobili started draping in orange, smeared Sandwood paste on his forehead, became vegetarian, even wore a sacred thread, and even practiced the caste system—all the marks of a Brahmin. While Goa was Europeanized, Madurai (where de Nobili operated) became Christianized, in a way.</p><p>In a way, Hinduism has not absorbed Christianity and Islam into its folds, as it has done various other local religions. It created a group of people who were fluid in their beliefs: Christians praying to local Hindu gods, Muslims practicing some Hindu customs or celebrating Hindu festivals, and Hindus going to Muslim shrines to make an offering for the sake of their sickly child. The work of de Nobili was accused of being a scam—him being labeled a "white Brahmin." These, still Catholic ideas, were to be challenged not by Hindus but by a new wave of zealous Protestant missionaries. The missionaries began treating the converts of the other faith as lowly 'neophytes', 'pariah', 'dregs of earth', 'enticed by the low of rupees'. The converted Indians were the victims. This is reflected even in modern day as extreme Hindus slander Christians as 'rice-bag' converts.</p><p>Decades later, different missionaries still found it quite hard to convince Hindus about their mission and their God.</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>'We do not say', the Hindus added, 'that yours is a false religion; it may be adapted to your wants' becase, in the end, god has 'appointed many different ways of going to heaven'.</p><p>In India, a multiplicity of beliefs was valid, while those of Europeans made sense in <em>their</em> situations (a principle in line with arguments made a thousand years ago by pagan intellectuals like Symmachus and Celsus). ... White men divided the world between Christians and heathers; to Hindus, on the other hand, heathens were those 'who live contrary to God', with bad habits and morals. And these existed in <em>all</em> religions.</p></div><p>Learning more about the Hindu reglion and it's various aspects of it, dismantled the prejudices of (some) missionaries like Bartholomaus Ziegenbalg.</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>Ziegenbalg slid from learning '<em>about</em> India to proposing that perhaps there was something to pick up '<em>from</em> India. That 'natives' were a thinking people, not fools flitting around malicious devils, also became clear through an 'interreligious dialogue' with Hindus.</p></div><p>In a fascinating turn of events, as the missionaries converged on the <em>Vedas</em> as the alleged definitive guide of the Hindus and translated them (to their advantage), these same texts were used <em>against</em> the Church back in their home. People of the Age of Enlightenment like Voltaire used (dubious) translations of vedas to argue that the Christian religion was a miserable copy of these ancient Hindu theology. As the Jesuits accussed of the Brahmins keeping their sacred texts and "hidden truths" among themselves, the Catholic church was similarly blamed during the Protestant Reformation and subsequently the age of Enlightenment.</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>Simply put, white intellectuals, dismissive of the Hindu society in the <em>present</em>, began to romanticise its past (a formula Hindus would in time also amplify).... They preferred Hinduism's hazy antiquity-where they could fill in the blanks as suited them-to its living reality.</p></div><p>These intellectuals presumed a Christian-style development of Hinduism - every written (Vedas mainly) was to be taken literally and everything else being practiced as a gross corruption or a perversion. We now know that Puranic Hinduism developed through interaction and now representative of Hindus at large. Hinduism was a "hybrid culture of overlapping theological encounters". The vedas themselves reflect this - the older portions (<em>karma-kanda</em>) dealing mainly with the rituals, sacrifices, invocations, while the later portions deal with more philosophical and metaphysical aspects (<em>Upanishads</em>). As much as 200 Upanishads (although only 108 <em>mukhya</em> upanishads are recognized as the core) have been catalogued - some written in as late as "medieval times".</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>Hindus, in the past as today, show no anxiety to gain direct access to the Vedas; Based on family, caste and regional traditions, faith remains available in a variety of formats, leaving scriptural concerns to Brahmins and philosophers.</p></div><p>Although the 'pure' Hinduism where every Hindu was a rigit votary of the Vedas never existed, it did find validation in the later rise of Hindu Nationalism. The western lament of the decline of the ancient pure Hinduism even found a place in the Brahmin concept of the "Kali Yuga", the dark age of corruption. Nonetheless, the white man's rule gave white men's ideas the muscle to remake reality.</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>Indeed, by the 1860s, it would be entirely normal for British judges in India, citing white scholars of Hinduism along with Protestant-style Hindu reformers, to decalre centiries old sects as 'contrary to ... the ancient [and thus, "real"] Hindu religion'.</p><p>But even in battling colonialism, and its ideological filters-shaped by Christianity, Western contests, the Enlightenment, and plain misreading-certain European filters were, nontheless coopted. Wedding to matching indigenous ideas, these would be recast as, in fact, Indian. It was in these circumstances that Hinduism's current avatar emerged-with one foot in tradition, the other in European sensibilities and confusion.</p></div><p>The late 17th century saw the begining of Brahmin domination in the political and juidicial affairs of the land - across various overlords - be it the Hindu Marathas, Muslim Nawabs, or Christian Governor Generals. The identification of Brahmins as the defenders and upholders of the land's culture and traditions by the missionaries was being used by the British to pose a continuation of the status quo to the Indian people. As such, Governor generals often received paens for their victory or for following the <em>Brahmin shastras</em> or local <em>sampradayas</em> (traditions) in various judicial matters <sup id=fnref:note><a class=fnref href=#fndef:note>[1]</a></sup>. Slowly, Brahmins were exployed by the British in various administrative positions. The puppet states followed suit in employing Brahmins in administrative positions.</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>For as anthropologist Bernard Cohn observed, the conquest of India was as much a 'conquest of knowledge' as it was of land and goods. As to pull on under colonial rule, Indian internalized even error, shrewdly learning to exploit it for their own purposes.</p></div><p>The administrative and judicial coersion of the British rule, cajoled the majority population to identitfy overwhelmingly based on religion.</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>Now, though, Hindu thinkers could focus more and more on what made them a single grouping; to construct unity despite diversity. History, knowledge and even the English language, would grow key to this. So much so that if Portuguese persecution in Goa had been a local affair, it would eventually be perceived in national accounts as an attack on subcontinental Hindus as a whole-as a people.</p></div><p>With the influence of western medicine and technological developments, a small renaissance also occurred in some Hindu puppet states. Rajas like Serfoji II Bhonsle of Thanjavur, Jai Singh of Jaipur, and some Travancore Rajas encouraged and promoted western sciences, arts, literature in conjuction with a revival of local arts and sciences. This, to the admiration and surprise of the British, did not go against the notion of being a Hindu. Scientific investigation was part of Hindu way of life argued Serfoji II, for instance. While the missionaries could only view Hindu religion with their Christian blinkers, the British were open to actually <em>studying</em> the religion and culture in a zeal to <em>rule</em> over it.</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>As the historial Richard Drayton notes, 'Service to the cause of Knowledge lent dignity to an enterprise which might have appeared otherwise as mere plunder and rapine.'</p></div><p>On the otherside, the white men, from the late 18th and 19th centuries, started discovering Sanskrit texts - initially to understand the Hindu law and religion, but eventually the literature and poetry. Their translation to English (and later German, and French), albeit censored and "purified", gave rise to tremendous interest in Sanskrit. Sanskrit was hailed as a wonderful language, even superior to Greek and Latin. This, coupled with the rising idea that Sanskrit was "mother of all subcontinental languages"<sup id=fnref:drav><a class=fnref href=#fndef:drav>[2]</a></sup>, lead to a disdain of other vernacular languages, like Bengali, as a mere corruption due to Islamic and Persian influence. This would, again, in time, be amplified by Hindu nationalists.</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>F. Max Muller, the celebrated Vedic expert, wrote of the Vedas as 'the root of Hinduism'. But while superior to living, Puranic traditions, this was, he added nontheless, 'childish and crude'-to show Hindus 'what that root is, is, I feel surel, the only way of uprooting all that has sprung from it during the last 3000 years'.... Or a collegue wrote to Muller, 'Your work will form a new era in the efforts for the conversion of India...by enabling us to compare that early false religion [of the Vedas] with the true.</p></div><p>Hindus too, in their own way, started to take part in and influenced this rise of subcontinental Orientalism. The associates to the British (now increasingly Brahmin), say what the British esteemed and pointed out Hindu parallels, prejudiced against Buddhist and Jain thought. Ironically, this orientalism enabled the Indians to viewe themselves as not inferior to the British and would slowly give rise to the Indian resistance. Even as early as 1857, the British sensed the use of Indian texts that they treasured like the <em>Gita</em> were begining to be used as motive for resistance.</p><br><div class=multilinequote><p>If on the British side, powerful interests wished to use Sanskrit, impart Western ideas to lites through this medium and leave them to filter dowm, influencial 'natives' wanted direct access to English.</p></div><hr><p>All the above excerpts are attributed to their original author(s).
