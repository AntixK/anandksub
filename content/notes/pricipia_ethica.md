&emsp; Moore raises two questions on ethics and tries to distinguish them - "What kind of things out to exist for their own sake?" (good in itself or has intrinsic value) and "What kind of actions ought we to perform?" (action is right or a duty). Based on these two questions, he discovers the more fundamental question - "what is the nature of (necessary) evidence, by which alone any ethical proposition can be proved or disproved, confirmed or rendered doubtful.

The earlier ethics (in the west) mostly dealt with absolutisms such as "Pleasure *alone* is good". Such arguments, coupled with their detailed cause-effect discussions lead to a list of "virtues" that were considered good, bad, or indifferent.
