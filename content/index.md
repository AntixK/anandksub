## Hi, 

This is Anand (アナンド, if you prefer). I spend the majority of my time trying to understand the nuances of Deep Neural Networks, if not AI at large. I currently work at [Bodygram](https://bodygram.com/en/), Tokyo as an Machine Learning Engineer. On a good day, I have at least a handful of *failed* ideas, or ideas that don't really work, which I realise while working out the math or while implementing.   

I can passionately talk for hours on *Karnatik Music* (South-Indian Classical music), Philosophy of Art, and Science in general. Recently, I have picked up a passion for hiking and working my way up the [`日本百名山`](hyakumeizan/) (100 Famous Mountains in Japan). I had previously worked on embedded systems and robotics before transitioning into Machine Learning.
